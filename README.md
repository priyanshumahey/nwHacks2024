# NWHacks 2024
We have been hacking my calendar for over 3 years and using it as a surface to log thoughts, make to-do lists, and write insights about books we read or videos we watch in a certain time block. Calendars have the potential to be more.

Our project transforms traditional calendars by infusing them with rich insights and predictive capabilities. Beyond basic scheduling, we're making calendars context-aware, turning them into dynamic tools for both information and foresight. This leap forward in calendar functionality promises to revolutionize personal and professional time management

We built our solution using a combination of React for the front end, leveraging Next.js for seamless page transitions and API interactions. The backend is powered by Next.js and Python, with secure authentication via Google OAuth. Data persistence is handled by a MySQL database through PlanetScale, connected by our custom ORM, Drizzle Corm. The entire architecture was developed within an ambitious 24-hour timeline.

A major challenge we ran into, we had to unify multiple data streams for all the APIs to work seamlessly together.

We will continue thinking through what the future of calendars looks like.
